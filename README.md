# JavaScript • SQL • Java — Learning Portfolio

This repository reflects my learning-focused journey in software development. I am not aiming to present myself as an expert or even a junior-level professional yet — instead, I describe myself as a motivated learner who understands core concepts, knows where to look, how to research, and how to improve through structured practice and critical thinking.

I actively use AI tools during learning, but not for copy-paste solutions. I analyze responses, verify correctness, explore edge cases, and focus on understanding underlying concepts rather than memorizing syntax.

## JavaScript (Foundational Level)

I have practical experience with **vanilla JavaScript** and browser-based programming fundamentals.

### What I currently work with:
- Variables, data types, scope (`var`, `let`, `const`)
- Control structures (conditions, loops)
- Functions (parameters, return values, arrow functions)
- Arrays, strings, objects, and built-in methods
- DOM selection, manipulation, and element creation
- Event handling (mouse, keyboard, input events)
- Basic state persistence using `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`
- Introductory object-oriented concepts (classes, constructors, inheritance)
- Asynchronous programming fundamentals (callbacks, promises, `fetch`, `async/await`)
- Debugging using browser developer tools and console logs

### Learning focus:
- Understanding how browser-based programs work internally
- Writing readable, structured, and testable code
- Building small interactive applications to reinforce concepts
- Developing the habit of researching documentation and verifying behavior experimentally

## SQL & HSQLDB (Introductory Level)

I have foundational experience with **relational databases** using **HSQLDB**, mainly through hands-on experimentation in its native interface.

### What I can currently do:
- Create and modify tables (`CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`)
- Insert, update, delete, and query records (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT`)
- Understand basic relational structures and table schemas

### Scope:
- Worked directly in the HSQLDB console/interface
- Have not yet integrated databases into live application code
- Focused on understanding how structured data storage works conceptually and practically

## Java Console Projects Portfolio

This section showcases Java console applications developed as part of my structured learning path. The projects focus on clarity, correctness, and conceptual understanding rather than production-level architecture.

### Projects Summary

**1️⃣ Simple Shopping Calculator — Programma Spesa**  
Purpose: Calculate total cost of shopping items via console input.  
Concepts: Scanner input, arithmetic operations, conditional logic, basic validation.  
Repository: ShoppingProject  

**2️⃣ Java Console TV Simulator — Progetto Televisore**  
Purpose: Simulate TV behavior (on/off, channels, volume, brightness) using internal state tracking.  
Concepts: Object-oriented programming, encapsulation, menu-driven interaction.  
Repository: java-tv-simulator  

**3️⃣ Trieste Library Project — Sistema Biblioteca**  
Purpose: Manage a small library system (view, search, add, delete, update books).  
Concepts: OOP, `ArrayList` usage, console input handling, modular structure.  
Repository: LibraryProjectTrieste

## Technologies & Tools

- JavaScript (ES6+, DOM, Browser APIs)
- SQL (HSQLDB — introductory level)
- Java SE
- Console-based I/O (Scanner)
- Object-oriented programming fundamentals
- Core Java Collections (`ArrayList`)

---

## Learning Approach

- I prioritize understanding concepts over memorizing syntax
- I research official documentation and test assumptions experimentally
- I use AI tools as learning assistants, not solution generators
- I evaluate correctness, edge cases, and alternative approaches
- I focus on building strong foundations before moving to frameworks or advanced abstractions

---

## Goals

- Transition from console and browser-based exercises to real-world applications
- Connect Java programs to relational databases via JDBC
- Learn modern frontend frameworks and backend APIs
- Improve software design, testing, and architectural skills
- Build reliable, maintainable systems step by step
