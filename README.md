# JavaScript • Databases • C# & Unity • Java — Learning Portfolio

This repository reflects my transition from product and business development into hands-on software development. After years of working as a founder and manager — especially in product strategy and system design — I decided to deepen my technical skills and understand software from the inside out.

I do not present myself as a software developer yet. I consider myself a motivated learner who understands core concepts, knows how to research effectively, and approaches problems analytically. I actively use AI tools during learning, but never as copy-paste solutions: I validate outputs, analyze edge cases, and focus on conceptual understanding rather than surface-level syntax.

> Note: Most of my public GitHub repositories currently focus on Java because these projects were developed recently within the ENAIP training context and are shareable. Due to sudden country transitions, I no longer have access to several earlier projects built in other environments and languages.

## JavaScript (Foundational Level)

I have hands-on experience with **vanilla JavaScript** for building interactive browser-based programs and understanding how frontend logic works under the hood.

### What I currently work with:
- Variables, data types, scope (`var`, `let`, `const`)
- Control flow (conditions, loops)
- Functions (parameters, return values, arrow functions)
- Arrays, strings, objects, and built-in methods
- DOM selection, manipulation, and element creation
- Event handling (mouse, keyboard, input events)
- Basic client-side persistence (`localStorage`, `sessionStorage`)
- Introductory OOP concepts (classes, constructors, inheritance)
- Asynchronous fundamentals (callbacks, promises, `fetch`, `async/await`)
- Debugging using browser developer tools and console logs

### Learning focus:
- Understanding how browser programs actually execute
- Writing readable and structured code
- Researching documentation and validating assumptions experimentally
- Building small interactive projects to reinforce concepts

## Databases & SQL (HSQLDB — Introductory Level)

I have foundational experience with **relational databases** using **HSQLDB**, mainly through direct experimentation in its native interface.

### What I can currently do:
- Create and modify tables (`CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`)
- Insert, update, delete, and query data (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT`)
- Understand table schemas, basic constraints, and relational structure

### Scope:
- Worked directly inside the HSQLDB console/interface
- Have not yet connected databases to live application code
- Focused on understanding how structured data storage works conceptually and practically

---

## C# & Unity (Foundational / Exploratory Level)

I have hands-on exposure to **C# and Unity**, where I built several small **hyper-casual game prototypes** for learning purposes.

### What I practiced:
- C# syntax, variables, conditionals, loops, and methods
- Unity’s component-based architecture (`GameObject`, `MonoBehaviour`)
- Basic player movement, collisions, scoring logic, and scene flow
- Understanding how game loops, events, and state transitions work

### Scope:
- Projects were experimental and not published
- Focus was on understanding programming logic through real-time systems
- No production or commercial deployment experience

## Java Console Projects Portfolio

This section showcases Java console applications developed as part of my structured learning path. The projects focus on clarity, correctness, and conceptual understanding rather than production-level architecture.

### Projects Summary

**1️⃣ Simple Shopping Calculator — Programma Spesa**  
Purpose: Calculate total cost of shopping items via console input.  
Concepts: Scanner input, arithmetic operations, conditional logic, basic validation.  
Repository: ShoppingProject (https://github.com/AtakanKayatekin/ShoppingProject.git)

**2️⃣ Java Console TV Simulator — Progetto Televisore**  
Purpose: Simulate TV behavior (on/off, channels, volume, brightness) using internal state tracking.  
Concepts: Object-oriented programming, encapsulation, menu-driven interaction.  
Repository: java-tv-simulator (https://github.com/AtakanKayatekin/java-tv-simulator.git)

**3️⃣ Trieste Library Project — Sistema Biblioteca**  
Purpose: Manage a small library system (view, search, add, delete, update books).  
Concepts: OOP, `ArrayList` usage, console input handling, modular structure.  
Repository: LibraryProjectTrieste (https://github.com/AtakanKayatekin/LibraryProjectTrieste.git)

## Technologies & Tools

- JavaScript (ES6+, DOM, Browser APIs)
- SQL (HSQLDB — introductory level)
- C# (Unity Engine — foundational level)
- Java SE
- Console-based I/O (Scanner)
- Object-oriented programming fundamentals
- Core Java Collections (`ArrayList`)

---

## Learning Approach

- I prioritize understanding concepts over memorizing syntax
- I research official documentation and test assumptions experimentally
- I use AI tools as learning assistants, not solution generators
- I evaluate correctness, edge cases, and alternative approaches
- I focus on building strong foundations before moving to frameworks or advanced abstractions

---

## Goals

- Work on real-world projects rather than isolated exercises
- Gain experience building end-to-end systems with real users and constraints
- Learn how to design, build, and iterate on production-oriented software
- Improve architectural thinking, testing practices, and long-term maintainability
- Grow through internships, mentorship, and collaborative development environments

---

## Interests

- **B2B platforms and SaaS products**, especially systems focused on workflow optimization and automation  
- **Mobile applications and casual/hyper-casual games**, where fast iteration and feedback loops matter  
- **Product strategy and problem-solving**, more than visual or aesthetic design  
- Prefer learning **engineering and delivery frameworks** (React, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Xcode) over design tools (Figma, Photoshop etc.), with a focus on building functional, usable, and outcome-driven products  
- Interested in turning abstract problems into working systems that solve real needs rather than optimizing for purely visual presentation
