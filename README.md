# Java Console Projects Portfolio

This repository showcases a collection of Java console applications developed as part of my structured Java learning journey. Each project demonstrates core programming concepts, from basic procedural logic to object-oriented design and state management.

## Projects Summary

### 1️⃣ Simple Shopping Calculator — *Programma Spesa*
- **Purpose:** Calculate total cost of shopping items (pencils, notebooks) via console input.
- **Concepts:** Scanner input, conditional logic, arithmetic operations, input validation.
- **Repository:** [ShoppingProject](https://github.com/AtakanKayatekin/ShoppingProject.git)

### 2️⃣ Java Console TV Simulator — *Progetto Televisore*
- **Purpose:** Simulate TV behavior (on/off, channels, volume, brightness) with state tracking.
- **Concepts:** OOP, encapsulation, stateful objects, menu-driven interaction.
- **Repository:** [java-tv-simulator](https://github.com/AtakanKayatekin/java-tv-simulator.git)

### 3️⃣ Trieste Library Project — *Sistema Biblioteca*
- **Purpose:** Manage a small library system (view, search, add, delete, update books).
- **Concepts:** OOP, ArrayList management, console input handling, modular architecture.
- **Repository:** [LibraryProjectTrieste](https://github.com/AtakanKayatekin/LibraryProjectTrieste.git)

## Technologies
- Java SE
- Console-based I/O (`Scanner`)
- OOP principles (classes, encapsulation, getters/setters)
- Core Java Collections (`ArrayList`)

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Developed clean and readable Java code
- Applied OOP principles in practical projects
- Built menu-driven console applications
- Managed stateful objects and input validation
- Structured small-scale projects for clarity and scalability

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add persistence (file/database)
- Implement unit testing (JUnit)
- GUI versions (JavaFX/Swing)
- Improved input handling and scalability
- Reusable utility libraries
